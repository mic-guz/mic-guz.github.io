# Michael Guzman's Portfolio 

     

I am a Computer Science at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2028. 

     

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs  

     

Lab 2: In this lab we mainly were just getting the hang of the basics with C++. But even though these labs were pretty 
    simple, I found them very enjoyable because when you start getting to know the basics, it fuels your drive to learn 
    more. Using std::cout and std::cin were the main objectives here. 

     

     

Lab 7 - This lab was a big one focused on creating a function that would test to see if you could part on a certain
    street, at a certain time by the parameters entered into the terminal. I found this lab challenging and fun because
    it felt rewarding building this big thing and then swapping out the parameters. It took us a long time to finish
    this code, but we got the correct end result and I was proud of my work. 

     

     

Lab 8: This lab is one of my favorites of the entire course, especially part 2 of this lab, where we had to code a
    pattern with 3 separate for loops within each other. I just found it really fun with testing and see how we were
    getting closer and closer to solving the lab. Part 1 was alright, I enjoyed calculating the average scores
    for the olympic judges.
